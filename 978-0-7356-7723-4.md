Question 1, option 4 states "Answers B & C" - where answers are numbered.  Perhaps this should read "Answers 1 & 2", or the answer options should be labelled A,B,C etc

## 3. Designing and implementing WCF Services > Objective 3.6: Version a WCF service> Objective review
Correct answers are referred to as A,C - whereas the answers are numbered.

## 3. Designing and implementing WCF Services>Answers>Objective 3.6: Review> Answer 1
The Authors assertion that contract changes are a breaking change is incorrect.  Steps to confirm that contracts can change be be non-breaking 

* Using Visual Studio 2015, Create a simple WCF sample project.
* Add a consumer windows commandline consumer.
* Get the consumer compiling and running,  calling the service.  
* Running the service started the WCF hosting service, which means that the service can be called from the compiled client.
* Now remove the consumer client from the solution.
* Modify the IService1 interface, adding in 2 OperationContract attributed methods, which would (according to this answer be  a breaking change).  
* Compile and run the service
* Confirm that the client is stil able to access the service

Have been able to demonstrate that additions are not a breaking change, making this answer incorrect.

## 3. Designing and implementing WCF Services>Answers>Objective 3.6: Review> Answer 3
Have been able to demonstrate that this update applied to an existing service won't break the existing client.  This answer is incorrect.  In addition the question did not mention keeping a version 10 and version 11 of the service, but instead talked about updating version 10.  Perhaps this question could be more clearly worded.  In anycase the new service will still work find for old clients - meaning that this answer is wrong.

## 3. Designing and implementing WCF Services>Answers>Objective 3.6: Review> Answer 4
Have been able to demonstrate that answers 2 and 3 are correct, therefore making 4 correct - again this question suffers from identifying the other options by alphabetical characters rather than numerical.
