# MSPressErrata
An Errata collection for MS Press books.

### Overview
Back in 2014 I submitted errata for a MS Press text book - 70-480 through the MS Press web site.  At the current time of writing, this errata was submitted 3 years ago and to date there has been no feedback regarding this.

An errata is vital when you are trying to learn a technology, and given the lack of response from Microsoft around the quality of their publications, I decided the best thing to do would be to create an errata that would be useful to other potential readers of MS press books.  

### How it's going to work
I'm suggesting that we create a document that would allow users to fork, add errata and re-submit it.
