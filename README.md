# MSPressErrata
An Errata collection for MS Press books.

### Overview
Back in 2014 I submitted errata for a MS Press text book - 70-480 through the MS Press web site.  At the current time of writing, this errata was submitted 3 years ago and to date there has been no feedback regarding this.

-- UPDATE --
I have now recieved some updates from @MicrosoftPress.  Much of the inactivity seems to be related to wanting to confirm errata before publishing them.

An errata is vital when you are trying to learn a technology, and given the lack of response from Microsoft around the quality of their publications, I decided the best thing to do would be to create an errata that would be useful to other potential readers of MS press books.  

### How it's going to work
I'm suggesting that we create a document that would allow users to fork, add errata and re-submit it. 

### So - What's the format?
Well I only have Errata for 1 book (because that's the book I'm reading) but I've created a file based on the isbn number of the book.  That file contains : 

* The Title,
* The authors, 
* A list of erata

### How do I reference a section?
Phyical books is fairly simple - use the page number and paragraph to identify areas where there are mistakes.  For Ebooks this is somewhat more complicated,  I've used the idea that the location should describe how to get to that location in your reader of choice.  So - for example : 

3. Designing and implementing WCF Services > Objective 3.6: Version a WCF service> Objective review

equates to :
* Go to "3. Designing and implementing WCF Services" - you might be able to get there through your Table of Contents
* Next - within that section look for "Objective 3.6: Version a WCF service"
* Finally within that section look for "Objective review"
